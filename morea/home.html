<p>The University of Hawaii, Manoa Course Catalog describes ICS 211 as “Algorithms and their complexity, introduction to software engineering, data structures, searching and sorting algorithms,
numerical errors.”  This course explores Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and software engineering techniques using Javascript.</p>

<p>The primary focus of this course is understanding and using Abstract Data Structures in programs.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> A grade of “B” or higher in 111 or instructor’s consent.</p>

<p><em>All students wishing to enroll in ICS courses above 211 except ICS 241 must meet the prerequisite grade requirement of B or higher in ICS 111 and 211 prior to registering for the course.</em></p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>The primary goal of ICS 211: Introduction to Computer Science II is to teach you about standard data structures, including lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary trees.</p>

<p>A second goal is to advance your Javascript programming skills. We will be writing a wide variety of Javascript code this semester.</p>

<h2 id="pedagogy">Pedagogy</h2>

<p>ICS 211 is structured as a sequential series of <a href="modules">modules</a>, each taking approximately one to two weeks to complete. Each module has the following structure:</p>

<ul>

Effective Fall 2015, each university and community college campus offering this course has agreed to:

Course alpha and number: ICS 211 (3 or 4 credits) or CS 151 (3 credits)

Course title: Introduction to Computer Science II

Course description: Reinforce and strengthen problem-solving skills using abstract data types and introduce software development practices. Emphasize the use of searching and sorting algorithms and their complexity, recursion, object-oriented programming, and data structures.

Prerequisite: ICS 111 with a grade of “B” or higher, or instructor consent.

Student Learning Outcomes

1. Use and implement abstract data types such as lists, stacks, queues, and trees.

2. Select the appropriate searching or sorting algorithm based on the algorithm’s behavior.

3. Develop recursive algorithms and programs.

4. Use standard libraries or packages as well as advanced object-oriented programming techniques (polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation).

5. Produce robust and secure programs using exception handling and extensive program testing.

  <h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>

<p>This course has three exams (including the final exam) and a number of homework assignments.</p>

<p>Grades are assigned based on your performance on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two mid-term exams, each worth 10% of the grade and a final worth 20% for at total of 40% of the grade.</li>
  <li>Assignments, worth a total of 30% of the grade.</li>
  <li>Lecture quizzes, worth 20% of the grade.</li>
  <li>Lab attendance, worth 10% of the grade.</li>
  <li>There will also be up to 5% extra credit awarded by each TA.</li>
</ul>

<p>Grading will use the standard cutoffs of 97% (A+), 93% (A), 90% (A-), 87% (B+), 83% (B), 80% (B-), 77% (C+), 73% (C), 70% (C-), 67% (D+), 63% (D), 60% (D-).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that you need a B or better in ICS 211 (83% or more) to take ICS 311.</p>

<p>The homeworks are graded by the Teaching Assistant (TA), the exams by the instructor. Any questions should be directed accordingly.</p>

<p>Unless stated otherwise, homeworks will be due on Fridays, at 11:59 pm. All homeworks <strong>must</strong> be turned in on time, that is, by midnight Friday if the due date is Friday. <strong>There are no extensions</strong> so plan your time wisely. You are more than welcome to turn in your assignment ahead of time. The assignment is submitted following the instructions given in the first lab.</p>

<p>Your grade on an assignment may be affected if you fail to follow the instructions for completing and submitting the assignment (So, follow the instructions!).</p>

<p>It is to every student’s advantage to turn in assignments by the due date, even if the assignment is not complete. This gives the possibility of obtaining at least partial credit for the work done. Assignments not turned in by the due date will get no credit.</p>

<p>Exams are in-class, closed book, closed notes, closed laptop, with no calculators or any other tools (electronic or otherwise) allowed. Exams include programming problems.</p>

<p><strong>Exams may be taken early, if requested at least one week before the scheduled time.</strong> Under no circumstances may an exam be taken late. If an exam is missed for a very good, well documented reason, the next exam will count twice as much, except for the final, in which case an incomplete will be given.</p>

<p>Class participation is encouraged. Comments and questions are particularly helpful to the instructor and generally to the class. If needed to encourage class participation, the instructor may call on students to answer specific questions or contribute opinions. Participation in class should be friendly, relaxed, and mutually respectful.</p>

<h3 id="cheating">Cheating</h3>

<p>In general, cheating means presenting the work of somebody else as one’s own, or providing one’s work to somebody else to help them cheat.</p>

<p>In the past, TAs have detected cheating on homeworks. Don’t do it!!!</p>

<p><strong>No Cheating Policy:</strong> any cheating will result in a grade of 0 for the assignment or exam the first time it is detected, and a grade of F for the course for any subsequent instance. Any instance of cheating will also be recorded in the student’s ICS department file, and may be reported to the office of the Dean of Students, possibly resulting in disciplinary action against the student.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://studentaffairs.manoa.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct_code/system_scc.php">Student Conduct Code</a> has more details on both impermissible behavior (see for example section IV.B.1 of the policies, Acts of dishonesty) and possible disciplinary sanctions.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact the instructor or the TAs.</p>
